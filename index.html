  <h1>AD HOMINEM</h1>
  <p>We offer hatred<br>
  as though it were<br>
  a fact of its object,<br>
  when its only truth<br>
  is our lens,<br>
  its certitude our seething.<br>
  The dastardly man<br>
  is loved, probably,<br>
  by his dog, if no one else is willing.<br>
  In that evidence the antidote,<br>
  the earth is not flat yet.<br>
  The unhated comes around<br>
  heralding relief. It is permitted<br>
  to describe ourselves<br>
  in vocary other than rage,<br>
  to insist on blooming<br>
  despite the pavement<br>
  through its cracks.</p>
  <p>More poems coming soon!</p>
