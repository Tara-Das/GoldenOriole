  <title>DESPERATELY RAISING DAWN</title>

<body>
<h1>AD HOMINEM</h1>
  
<p>We offer hatred<br>
<p>as though it were<br>
<p>a fact of its object,<br>
<p>when its only truth<br>
<p>is our lens,<br>
<p>its certitude our seething.<br>
<p>The dastardly man<br>
<p>is loved, probably,<br>
<p>by his dog, if no one else is willing.<br>
<p>In that evidence of the antipode,<br>
<p>the earth is not flat yet.<br>
<p>The unhated comes around<br>
<p>heralding relief. It is permitted<br>
<p>to describe ourselves<br>
<p>in vocabulary other than rage,<br>
<p>to insist on blooming<br>
<p>despite the pavement<br>
<p>through its cracks.<br>
